      <p class="heading">Our History & Impact in Mumbai (2024)</p>
      <div class="para">
        <p>
          Mumbai, a city deeply rooted in spirituality, has long upheld the sacred tradition of Annadanam (food donation). At Share A Meal, we have worked closely with Hindu temples, dharamshalas, charitable trusts, and NGOs to ensure that no prasad or surplus food goes to waste while many still go hungry.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          In February 2024, during Maha Shivratri, we collaborated with Babulnath Temple and Mumbadevi Temple, collecting over 6,000 meals from temple donations. These meals were then distributed to orphanages and homeless shelters through Annapurna Seva Trust, ensuring that the blessings of prasad reached those in need.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          As part of our Ram Navami Feast in April 2024, we received a generous donation of prasad and fresh meals from ISKCON Juhu, amounting to over 12,000 servings. This food was shared with underprivileged families in Dadar, Sion, and Ghatkopar, through our trusted NGO partners Seva Kitchen Mumbai and Roti Ghar NGO.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          During Navratri in October 2024, the Shri Siddhivinayak Temple Trust contributed an astounding 25,000 meals to support devotees and the underprivileged. These meals were sent to Mumbai Roti Bank and Snehalaya NGO, where they were distributed to shelters, old-age homes, and families in need across the city.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          In January 2024, as part of our Makar Sankranti Food Drive, we partnered with Shree Gaushala Trust, collecting fresh meals, milk, and grains. These offerings were shared with Annamrita Foundation and Satya Sai Seva Sangh, ensuring that temple workers and poor families received nourishment during the festival.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Through these efforts, we continue to uphold the principles of Sanatan Dharma, ensuring that sacred food reaches those who need it most.

     <!-- <p class="heading"> Our Story</p>
     <div class="para">
       <p>Our journey began with a realization that food waste is a significant problem in India. According to a report by the United Nations, India is the world's second-largest food producer, yet it also has one of the highest rates of food waste. This waste has a significant impact on the environment, as well as on food security in the country.</p>
